                <p>The birth of this LFC family comes from Ulster University of Jordanstown, created and developed by an Interactive Multimedia Design student.
                The incentive is really to work on a project where the subject is much loved by the developer. To further enhance this project, it has to have its
                own characteristics and features. Our aim is really to publish and upload content that we feel the most relevant and entertaining. </p>

                            It all started with the passionate love for the club. Even when in University, LFC was always being checked on regarding its
                            activities, squad news, players social medias, transfer news and many more. The objective of this platform is to further enjoy
                            how us fans consume more information about the club. </p> <br>
                                <p> We want to solely focus on ensuring that the contents being published
                            are fan driven as opposed to paid sponsorships or the logic of "adding more content for the sake of it". </p>
                        </div>

                        <p> We want to create a community filled with passionate Liverpool Football Club fans. A community that will share strong
                        opinions, shout their thoughts, and to ultimately communicate to feel each others feelings for the club. If you
                        want to further contact us for whatever reason, please feel free to do so via our <a style="color: red;" href="/contact">Contact Page</a></p>
